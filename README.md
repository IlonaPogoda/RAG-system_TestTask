RAG System for Scientific Articles
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering research questions based on a collection of scientific articles.
The system performs document retrieval, aggregation at the PDF level, and answer generation using a large language model.

The project was developed and tested in Google Colab.
